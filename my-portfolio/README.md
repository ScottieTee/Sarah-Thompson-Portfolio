I’m Sarah Thompson, a full-stack developer. 

I’ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered full-stack development, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I don’t think people should settle for generic applications or forego their overall vision due to dated programming restraints. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being both a designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation. Take a look at some of my work below!
